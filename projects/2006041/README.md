### <a name="goal"></a> Goals
I would like to work on front-end technologies, like HTML, JS and CSS, so that I can enhance my coding skills and my ability to create and enhance web content.
Also,  I would to take the opportunity to get more familiar with the Linux command line and various command line utilities that can enhance my experience as a developer and make
the experience of interacting with resources both locally and those hosted online a lot more seamless and effortless. 
On top of that, exploring git functionalities and workflows is a much needed skill in any developer's toolkit, as it's an intergral part of collaborating on coding projects and writing production code.


### <a name="button"></a> Button Programming Exercise
For this programming exercise, I changed the implementation of the button by linking the click user action to a new tab opening and serving a webpage that hosts weather forecasts with the weather in Corfu. The button look (color, symbols from the Font Awesome CSS library, etc.) and text have been appropriately modified to convay to the user information about the functionality of the button and type of action they can perform by cliking it.

### <a name="CommandLineExercise"></a> Command Line Exercise: Dependencies & Base System
For this command line exercise, I completed the *"set-up the main dependencies and demonstrate your base system"* assignment which had the following tasks to complete:
- **change your command prompt with your student ID:** I used `sudo nano` to open with superuser privileges the `.bashrc` file with the nano text editor. The `.bashrc` shell script contains the configurations for the terminal session and is run at the beginning of a new Bash session so we can introduce there a change to a special shell variable, PS1, which is used as the new prompt string. We then call `source` on the `.bashrc` shell script to execute its contents so that the PS1 value change can take effect in our running session. 
- **list your dot files change:** We use the `find` utility that looks for files and directories through the directories hierarchy so that we can locate all dot/hidden files and directories starting from the route directory. By passing in the argument `name` the regex `.[^.]*` we are excluding the special Linux directories `.` and `..`, and then by introducing the argument `-type f` we are only retrieving dot files, not directories.    
- **display your shell configuration file:** we use `less` with the `.bashrc` shell script to show our shell configurations since we are only interested in displaying them and not editing them.
- **display system information (hardware+software):** we use the `neofetch` command line utility that we have installed and in order to display more info regarding the state of our software and hardware we edit the `config.conf` configuration file of `neofetch` that controls what information is displayed when the `neofetch` utility is invoked from the command line. We enable then some extra display options by editing this file with the nano text editor, uncommenting the lines that display this extra information and then after saving we run `neofetch` and have the default plus the extra information displayed.

### <a name="css"></a> CSS Media Queries Programming Exercise
For this programming exercise, I implemented changes changes to the CSS Media Queries exercise, by introducing more @media queries dependent on screen width and adapting the colors from green to red as the screen is squeezed. The font side is also adapted for the changing screen size.

### <a name="vim"></a> Command Line Exercise: vim text editor and plug-ins
For this command line exercise, I completed the *"text editor and plug-ins for code highlighting and autocompletion"* assignment.
I used the vim text editor and `vi` to to edit the .vimrc config file for the vim editor. I downloaded `Vundle`, a vim plugin manager that allows users to keep track of and configure the vim plugins right in the `.vimrc` file. I then included in the `.vimrc` file and installed the `youcompleteme` plugin for test autocompletition. I also included in the `.vimrc` file configuration for syntax highlighting.

### <a name="collab"></a> Collaborative Exercise
For this collaborative exercise I forked the 2 submodules, `_gallery` and `images`, changed the references of the submodules in my forked repo of `site` to point to these forked submodule repos, added 2 new entries in `_gallery` and `images` and added the references to the appropriate slides and chronology. Link to the `_gallery` forked repo can be found through this [link](https://github.com/elenberg-io/_gallery), link to the `images` forked repo can be found through this [link](https://github.com/elenberg-io/images) and link to the forked `site` repo can be found through this [link](https://github.com/elenberg-io/site).

### <a name="mouseeraser"></a> CSS Mouse Eraser Programming Exercise
For this programming exercise, I implemented changes changes to the Mouse Eraser exercise, by changing one of the pictures shown and also changing the size of the erase, by manipulating the canvas arc() method's radius argument that controls the radius of the circle of the eraser.
