## Key Features:
* Built on top of Ubuntu; Should work well on any Linux distribution that supports i3WM.
* Resembles Canonical's @Ubuntu [theme](https://design.ubuntu.com/brand/colour-palette/).
* Designed with minimalism in mind; Not many dependencies are required, only core utilities.
* i3lock-effect is custom work made by me using Python3.
